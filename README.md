Train Seat Booking System
This project is a train seat booking system that includes both frontend and backend components.

Project Structure
Frontend: Contains the user interface of the train seat booking system.
Backend: Handles the server-side operations and manages the booking system's logic, API calls, and database interactions.
Prerequisites
Make sure the following software is installed on your system before proceeding:

Node.js: For running the backend (Download from Node.js official website).
NPM: Comes with Node.js installation, used for managing dependencies.
Steps to Run
Backend Setup
Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the backend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd train_seat_booking/backend
Install the necessary packages by running:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the backend server by running:

bash
Copy code
node app.js
The backend should now be running at http://localhost:3000 or the port specified in the app configuration.

Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal or command prompt and navigate to the frontend folder:

bash
Copy code
cd train_seat_booking/frontend
Start the frontend server:

If it's a simple HTML file, you can open the file directly in your browser, or:
If you're using a frontend framework (like React, Angular, etc.), follow the respective steps to start the frontend server (e.g., npm start if React is used).
Notes
Ensure that the backend server is running before starting the frontend so that the APIs can be accessed properly.
Both servers need to be run in parallel for the system to work end-to-end.
